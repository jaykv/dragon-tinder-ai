# The Hunt

Inspired by modern-day online dating apps, The Hunt is your all-in-one career app. Managers (Hunters) are able to post specific job listings for their teams. Potential employees (Seekers) are able to swipe through and like/dislike available jobs. As Seekers use the app, the job cards presented to them are prioritized based on their previous job likes/dislikes. In addition, we have created a chatbot that allows companies to pre-screen candidates with personalized aptitude tests. If the candidate passes the aptitude test, the chatbot will use the manager's calendar to schedule an interview appointment with the candidate.

We built it using GCP Dialog as the chatbot, Microsoft Text Analysis API to find keywords from each job description to help prioritize the next cards, and Ionic to create the UI/UX.
